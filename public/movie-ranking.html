<h1>The Best Movies According to Mohamad</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
<p>This movie despite bieng produced in 2003 but its still have a huge impact especially these days with dull taste movies , this one delivers just good. No surprise with Tom cruiz movies.</p>

<h3>Revolver</h3>
<p>Now this one was tricky , I had to watch the movie for 100 times until I get it. But honestly it very dense movie with a meaning.</p>

<h3>Sherlock holmes</h3>
<p>How could you neglect such a movie if you are a fan of mystery and problem solving detective things. The greatest detective of all time really great movie , both this one and the second movie dubbed " Game of shadows"</p>

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>This one I started watching recently , it really gives you a closer look on what flying with a fighter jet is all about, moreover it gives you the impression about what seperates ageniun expert from crowds of so called experts.Quaity over quantity, we can put it that way</p>
